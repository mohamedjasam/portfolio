This GitHub repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, the portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a responsive and visually appealing manner. Feel free to explore the code and use it as inspiration for creating your own portfolio.
